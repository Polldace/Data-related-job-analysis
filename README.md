# Data-related-job-analysis
I am interested in data field. So I did this project to explore the current state of the data-related job market. I wrote three Python scripts to scrap job information from a job-hunting website, then clean and analyse the data respectively. 

The Python script 'Scraper' is to get job information, 'Data clean' is to clean the data, and 'Data job analysis.ipynb' I wrote shows the data analysis results. The following questions will be answered:
* 1.Which Australian major city has most job positions?
* 2.Which industry needs to analyse data?
* 3.What types of jobs are available? 
* 4.What jobs pay what salary in different cities?
* 5.What skills are most valued in the data analysis/science/engineer field?
