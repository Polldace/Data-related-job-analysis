# Data-related-job-analysis
I am interested in data modelling and hoping to find opportunities in this field for my future career. So I did this project to explore the current state of the data-related job market. I scraped some job information from a job-hunting website, then cleaned and analysed the data. The whole process was implemented with Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn).

The Python script 'Data job analysis.ipynb' is to analyse Australian data job market with data I cleaned up. The following questions will be answered:
* 1.Which Australian major city has most job positions?
* 2.Which industry needs to analyse data?
* 3.What types of jobs are available? 
* 4.What jobs pay what salary in different cities?
* 5.What skills are most valued in the data analysis/science/engineer field?
