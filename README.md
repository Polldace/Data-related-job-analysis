# Data-related-job-analysis
I am interested in data and hoping to find opportunities in this field for my future career. So I did this project to explore the current state of the data-related job market. I scraped some job information from a job-hunting website. Then I cleaned and analysed the data. 
All work was done with Python (BeautifulSoup, nltk, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn).

The Python script 'Data job analysis.ipynb' shows the data analysis results. The following questions will be answered:
* 1.Which Australian major city has most job positions?
* 2.Which industry needs to analyse data?
* 3.What types of jobs are available? 
* 4.What jobs pay what salary in different cities?
* 5.What skills are most valued in the data analysis/science/engineer field?
