# Data-related-job-analysis
I am interested in data modelling and hoping to find opportunities in this field for my future career. So I investigated the data-related job market using some data analysis methods. I scraped some job information from a job-hunting website, then cleaned and analysed the data. The whole process was implemented with Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn).

The Python script 'Data job analysis.ipynb' is to analyse Australian data job market using cleaned up data. The following questions will be answered:
* 1.Which Australian major city has most job positions?
* 2.Which industry needs to analyse data?
* 3.What types of jobs are available? 
* 4.What jobs pay what salary in different cities?
* 5.What skills are most valued in the data analysis/science/engineer field?
